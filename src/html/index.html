            <p class = "medium">Tired of writing repeatitive CSS, that easily breaks and becomes cluttered quickly? Switch to writing sophisticated CSS using preprocessors! CSS preprocessors are scripting languages that extend the default capabilities of CSS. They make it easy to automate repetitive tasks, reduce the number of errors and code bloat, create reusable code snippets, and ensure backward compatibility. There are many CSS preprocessors to choose from, find out more about them below!</p>

        <p class="medium">CSS preprocessors add new syntax options that make your CSS more powerful. These features make the CSS structure more readable. This means that maintaining code will also be easier and in the long run it will be easier to edit. There are many CSS preprocessors to choose from. Most CSS preprocessors will add some features that don't exist in pure CSS, such as mixin, nesting selector, inheritance selector, and so on. These features make the CSS structure more readable and easier to maintain.</p>

            <h3 class="medium">When</h3>
            <p class="small">First introduced in 2006, Sass (Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets – a nice play on the official name of CSS) is considered to be the pioneer of CSS preprocessors. Less (Leaner Style Sheets) first appeared in 2009. It was influenced by Sass, but had its own influence on the later introduced SCSS format. Another CSS preprocessor called Stylus appeared on the market in 2010. PostCSS was initially released in 2013.</p>
        </section>
        <section class="feature">
            <h3 class="medium">How</h3>
            <p class="small">CSS preprocessors are scripting languages that extend the default capabilities of CSS. They enable us to use logic in our CSS code, such as variables, nesting, inheritance, mixins, functions, and mathematical operations. Each CSS preprocessor has its own syntax that they compile into regular CSS so that browsers can render it on the client side. Each of them has some advanced features unique to them and their own ecosystem (tools, frameworks, libraries) as well.</p>
        </section>
        <section class="feature">
            <h3 class="medium">Why</h3>
            <p class="small">The reason we're using CSS preprocessors is to add extra functionalities that CSS wouldn't otherwise have. For example, you could have nesting or inheritance selectors, as well as mixins (reusable declaration bundles). The handy additional features let you be more efficient in your daily work and provide you extra scalability.</p>

This means that you're depending on the continued support for your preprocessor language of choice.
